KVCObjectMapping
================

Subclass of NSObject class that provide a powerful object mapping system that reduces the amount of code you need to write to <b>get things done</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
This KVCObjectMapping class provides a modelling layer for mapping processed data
payloads into native Cocoa object declaratively. This lets developer stop worrying
about parsing and simply ask the object to populate information with the supplied dictionary.
<br/>
Object mapping is implemented using key-value coding, allowing for quick traversal
of the parsed object graph. Reflection is used on the property types to allow for mapping
from JSON string to object and from object to JSON string.
